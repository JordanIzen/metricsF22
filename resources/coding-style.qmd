title: "Suggested Code Style Guide"
---

We want to maximize *human*-readability of code, not just machine-readability. I try to follow [Hadley Wickham's style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) for all of my code, including that in this class.

*You will not be graded on the style of your code.* But now's the best time to learn best practices (while you don't know any alternatives!) to save yourself and your potential colleagues (including your future self) from unnecessary frustration.

- comment above for overall idea 
- comment on side for individual elements of long commands
- name with `_`
- use `%>%` wherever possible
- spaces between all operators: `<-`, `=`, `+`, etc.
    - Exception: `:` and `::`
- line breaks between multiple arguments to a function

```{r, eval = F}
p<-ggplot(data=data, aes(x=x,y=y,fill=fill))+geom_point()
```

becomes

```{r, eval = F}
p <- ggplot(data = data,
       aes(x = x,
           y = y,
           fill = fill))+
  geom_point()
```
