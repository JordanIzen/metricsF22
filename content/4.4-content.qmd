## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

This week we will cover non-linear models, which we anticipated last week with an interaction effect between two continuous variables: $X_1 \times X_2$, where the marginal effect of $X_1 \rightarrow Y$ is dependent on the value of $X_2$.

We cover two types of nonlinear models. *First*, we cover **polynomial models**, where we include higher-order $X$ variables to explain a non-linear effect. 

*Next* we will cover **logarithmic models**, which are more frequently used — as well as a few final tests and transformations for multivariate regression before we turn to panel data (Unit IV) next week: **standardizing variables** to compare effect sizes, and **joint hypothesis tests**.

Interpretting logged variables can often be difficult to remember, so here I reproduce the tables that describe the interpretations of the marginal effect of $X \rightarrow Y$, as well as some visual examples from the slides:

| Model | Equation | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Linear-**Log** | $Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 \mathbf{ln(X)}$ | 1% change in $X \rightarrow \frac{\hat{\beta_1}}{100}$ **unit** change in $Y$ |
| **Log**-Linear | $\mathbf{ln(Y)}=\beta_0+\beta_1X$ | 1 **unit** change in $X \rightarrow \hat{\beta_1}\times 100$**%** change in $Y$ |
| **Log**-**Log** | $\mathbf{ln(Y)}=\beta_0+\beta_1\mathbf{ln(X)}$ | 1**%** change in $X \rightarrow \hat{\beta_1}$**%** change in $Y$ |

- Hint: the variable that gets logged changes in **percent** terms, the variable not logged changes in *unit* terms

| Linear-Log | Log-Linear | Log-Log |

| $\hat{Y_i}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\mathbf{ln(X_i)}$ | $\mathbf{ln(\hat{Y_i})}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}X_i$ | $\mathbf{ln(\hat{Y_i})}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\mathbf{ln(X_i)}$ |
| $R^2=0.65$ | $R^2=0.30$ | $R^2=0.61$ |

After we finish, we will do another set of [practice problems](/r/4.4-r) in `R`., and you will be given your final graded [**HW 5**](/assignments/05-problem-set.qmd) to work on this material.

This week you will be working on [R practice problems](/r/4.4-r) on nonlinear data. Answers will be posted later on that page.

### Problem Set 5 Due Mon Nov 28
[Problem Set 5](/assignments/05-problem-set) is due by the end of the day on Wednesday, November 28.

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.

I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
