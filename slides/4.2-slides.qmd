[Structure of an Empirical Paper](#structure-of-an-empirical-paper)


## Research Question

- A good paper has a _specific_ [research question]{.hi} that you will ask and provide evidence towards a *clear*, *quantifiable* answer. Good research questions are:

. . .

1. **A claim** about something
	- [Capital punishment is the most efficient deterrent for violent crimes.]{.green}
	- [Women are paid, on average, 33% less than men performing the same work.]{.green}

. . .

2. **As specific as possible**, given the length constraints
  - [Do candidates that spend more money than their opponents tend to win Congressional races?]{.green}

. . .

3. **Testable**, with data that can provide *some* evidence one way or another
  - One study will never be “the” *definitive proof* of something, only *suggestive* evidence

# Structure of an Empirical Paper {.centered background-color="#314f4f"}

## Structure of an Empirical Paper

1. Introduction

2. Literature Review

3. Theory/Model

4. Data Description

5. Empirical Model

6. Results/Implications

7. Bibliography

## Introduction I

- Get to your research question ASAP!  Make it the first sentence even.

- Hook your reader
    - Who cares?  Why is this important?  Why is this relevant? How does this affect people?
		- Statistics and background information can often help

. . .

::: callout-tip
## Example
As a student writing an empirical research paper, does writing a longer paper earn a higher grade on the assignment?
:::

## Introduction II

- State your research question clearly and quickly

. . .

- [Do NOT write a “blog post”]{.red} about how you became interested in the question, or all the work (and dead-ends) that led you on the journey to reaching your final answer
  - [Nobody cares about the labor pains, they just want to see the baby!]{.hi-purple}

. . .

- Provide an outline of the rest of the paper:
  - Why your question matters
  - How you answer the question in this paper
  - What your identification strategy is and what models you use
  - What data you use
  - What your most important results are

## Introduction III

::: callout-tip
## Example
I estimate the relationship between paper length and grades by using a simple OLS regression using sample data collected from previous classes. I find that there is a weak positive effect, that students who write longer papers earn higher grades. On average, for every additional page written, grades improve by less than a point. These results are robust to a number of different model specifications and controls.
:::

## Introduction IV

- Most people will only read the introduction and conclusion of a paper

- Consider the incentives of a (skimming) reader pressed for time
    - If someone only skims your intro, what do you want them to know?
  


## Literature Review

- **Literature Review** can be summarized into the introduction or given its' own section (debatable; I prefer the former for my papers)

- [No work is totally original. It's okay!]{.hi-turquoise}
  - What have other relevant researchers written and discovered about your topic?
  - What data and models did they use? What did they find?
  - How does your paper connect and stand apart from what's been done?
    - Does your paper use different data? A different model? Different controls?

## Theory I
 
- Despite emprirical papers being centered around data, they should be motivated by economic theory

- Most scholarly papers have a formal economic model, which then generates predictions that they test for with data



## Theory II

::: callout-tip
## Example
Students that write longer papers likely place higher value on their work and dedicate more resources towards improving its quality, resulting in higher grades. 

However, some students may hope or believe that longer papers automatically lead to higher grades, and thus will merely put extra low quality filler in their paper to inflate the length. These papers turn out to be much worse quality, and these students likely earn *lower* grades as a result.
:::

## Data I

- Describe your data sources
  - Who collected or compiled the data and how? 
      - e.g. government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, social surveys, etc.
  - If *you* collected your own data (unlikely), what was your procedure?

## Data II

- Describe the data itself
  - What are your variables? What—*specifically*, and *in English*—does each measure?
  - How many observations do you have?
  - If you transformed your variables—how and why?
      - e.g. recoded into categories or dummies
      - e.g. took logs or rescaled units

## Data III

- [Show your data!]{.hi} Show us basic summary statistics and any patterns
  - Use your judgment: [we don't want or need to see *everything*]{.hi-purple}
  - What do you think is *interesting* or *important*?
  - Plots $>$ Tables $>$ Words $>$ Nothing

. . .

- Good ideas to *always* have:
  1. A table(s) of all variables used and their description
  2. A table(s) of summary statistics of variables
  3. A table of correlations of key variables (optional)
  3. Plots of (only) *the most important* variables & relationships (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc)


## Empirical Model 

- Describe your empirical model and your **identification strategy** 
    
- Why did you pick certain variables?

- How do you battle endogeneity?

- Hypothesize your expected size and magnitude of key variables
    - Give some **economic intution** behind what we would expect!


## Empirical Model 

::: callout-tip
## Example

\begin{align*}
\text{Paper Grade}_i=& \, \beta_0+\beta_1\text{Paper Length}_i+\beta_2\text{Course Grade}_i\\
&+\beta_3\text{Gender}_i+\beta_4\text{School}_i+\beta_5\text{Covid}_i\\
&+\beta_6\text{Course}_i+\beta_7\text{Remote}_i+u_i\\ \end{align*}
:::



## Empirical Model 

- Describe the **limitations of your model**
    - Every paper, even Nobel prize-winning ones, have limitations and problems!
    - Limited and/or poor quality data
    - Endogeneity, simultaneous causation, omitted variable bias

::: callout-tip
## Example
The model likely suffers from endogeneity, as how many pages a student writes is likely to be positively correlated with personal attributes like diligence, conscientiousness, and intelligence, which themselves are likely positively correlated with the grade of the paper. Thus, we have likely *over*stated the effect of page length on paper grades. Furthermore, we are unable to measure other variables that make page length endogenous, such as the topic that was chosen. Some topics lend themselves to shorter or longer papers and may have better or worse data that make it easier or difficult to run a clean empirical test.

:::

## Empirical Model 

- Are your results [robust]{.hi} across different model specifications?
  - Do the size(s) of the marginal effect(s) you care about change or reverse direction? Become/lose significance?
    
- At minimum, [you must run several models]{.hi-purple}, including a multivariate regression
  - Run **several variations** of your model with and without controls (e.g. just $Y$ and $X$, $Y$ and $X_1$ and $X_2$, etc.)
  - Check for nonlinearities: polynomials, logs, etc.


## Results 

- Print a table(s) of your regression(s) results 

- Interpret your data (in the text of the paper)
  - What does a marginal (1 unit) change in $X$ mean for $Y$, a 1% change, etc? 
  - Is each coefficient statistically significant (at 10%, 5%, or 1% levels)?

- Remember, graphs of estimates are better than just tables



## Results: Interpretation! 

- Are your estimates **economically significant**?

- How big is "big"?

> “No economist has achieved scientific success as a result of a statistically significant coefficient. Massed observations, clever common sense, elegant theorems, new policies, sagacious economic reasoning, historical perspective, relevant accounting, these have all led to scientific success. Statistical significance has not.” — McCloskey & Ziliak (1996: 112)


## Results: Interpretation! 

![](images/drwhocontext.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Results: Interpretation! 

::: callout-tip
## Example

I find that for every additional page written, we can expect a paper's grade to increase by about a point or less, after controlling for other factors such as Final grade (proxying as a measure of overall diligence and intelligence), sex, and course. In the most relevant sample, econometrics students, the marginal effect is even smaller, only less than half of a point increase for every additional page written.

However, we should not make much of these results due to the likely endogeneity of Pages due to unobserved factors such as topic and quality of writing, which clearly would matter much both for length and for grade. *It would be poor advice to recommend students simply to write long papers to earn a higher grade.*
:::


## Results: Implications

- Describe several *implications* of your paper
  - Policy implications
  - Proposals for new research
  - Effects on current understanding
  - What else should we try to found out to answer the question better?
