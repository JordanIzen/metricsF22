## Correlation Does Not Imply Causation

[Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

## Correlation Does Not Imply Causation...

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- It's always good to be skeptical of causal claims

- But this is actually where [econometrics]{.hi} shines

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/causation.jpg)
:::
:::

## Econometrics

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- [Econometrics]{.hi} is the application of statistical tools to *quantify* economic relationships in the real world

- Uses real data to
    - test economic hypotheses
    - quantitatively estimate the magnitude of relationships between economic variables
    - forecast future events 

:::

:::
:::

## Econometrics and Causal Inference

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- What sets econometrics apart from mere statistics (or uses of statistics in other disciplines) is its role in [causal inference]{.hi}

- We can, with proper tools and interprations, make *quantitative* *causal* claims
    - about the effects of individual choices
    - about the effects of policy interventions
    - about the impact of political institutions
    - about economic history and economic development
    - etc...

## Causal Inference: Examples {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

> A 50% increase in police presence in a metropolitan area lowers crime rates by 15%, on average^[Klick, Jonathan and Alexander Tabarrok, 2005, "Using Terror Alert Levels to Estimate the Effect of Police on Crime," *Journal of Law and Economics* 48(1): 267-279]

> Being an incumbent in office raises the probability of re-election by 40-45 percentage points^[Lee, David S, 2001, "The Electoral Advantage to Incumbency and Voters' Valuation of Politicians' Experience: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis of Elections to the U.S," *NBER Working Paper* 8441]

> European cities with at least one printing press in 1500 were at least 29% more likely to become Protestant by 1600^[Rubin, Jared, 2014, "Printing and Protestants: An Empirical Test of the Role of Printing in the Reformation," *Review of Economics and Statistics* 96(2): 270-286]

## Example 1: Education

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Example 
- Does reducing class sizes improve student performance?

:::

- A policy-relevant tradeoff with a budget constraint
- What is the *precise* effect of class size on performance?
- Is it worth hiring new teachers and building more schools over?

## Example 2: Discrimination in Lending

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Example 
- Is there racial discrimination in home mortgage lending?

:::

- Boston Fed: 28% of African-Americans are denied mortgages compared to only 9% of White Americans
- Is this due to factors such as credit history, income, or discrimination *purely* because of race?

## Example 3: Public Health and Public Finance

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Example 
- How much do state cigarette taxes reduce smoking rates?

:::

- Econ 101: raise price $\rightarrow$ lower quantity consumed
- What is the [price elasticity of demand]{.hi-turquoise} for smoking?
- How much tax revenue will this generate?
- Probably: $Taxes \rightarrow Smokers$
- Maybe?: $Taxes \leftarrow Smokers$

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

1. [Causal inference]{.hi}: estimate $\color{teal}{\hat{f}}$ to determine how changes in $\color{purple}{X}$ **cause** changes in $\color{orange}{Y}$
  - Care more about accurately estimating $\color{teal}{f}$ than getting an accurate $\color{orange}{\hat{Y}}$
  - Measure the **causal effect** of $X \mapsto Y$
  - primarily regression-based

::: {.column width="50"}
2. [Prediction]{.hi}: predict $\color{orange}{\hat{Y}}$ using an estimated $\color{teal}{f}$
  - Care more about getting $\color{orange}{\hat{Y}}$  as accurate as possible, $\color{teal}{f}$ is an unknown “black-box”
  - Use for **forecasting**, **classification**, etc.
  - less regression, more machine-learning methods

- More and more “data science” focuses on the second...but

- We care (in this class at least) only about the first...because

## Causal Inference — Economists' Comparative Advantage

- Machine learning and artificial intelligence are "dumb"^[For more, see [my blog post](https://ryansafner.com/post/econometrics-data-science-and-causal-inference/), and Pearl & MacKenzie (2018), *The Book of Why*]
- With the right models and research designs, we *can* say "X causes Y" and quantify it!
- Economists are in a unique position to make *causal* claims that mere statistics cannot

## Causal Inference — Economists' Comparative Advantage

[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2019/02/why-tech-companies-hire-so-many-economists)

“[T]he field of economics has spent decades developing a toolkit aimed at investigating empirical relationships, focusing on techniques to help understand which correlations speak to a causal relationship and which do not. This comes up all the time — does Uber Express Pool grow the full Uber user base, or simply draw in users from other Uber products? Should eBay advertise on Google, or does this simply syphon off people who would have come through organic search anyway? Are African-American Airbnb users rejected on the basis of their race? These are just a few of the countless questions that tech companies are grappling with, investing heavily in understanding the extent of a causal relationship.”
