Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus). \n\nThis is not just a “syllabus day,” as we need to hit the ground running, beginning with learning the software we will be using this semester. Starting next class, we will do a deep dive in to R for about 2 weeks. In preparation, please do the following **before next class**:\n\n1. Go to [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and register a (free) account with your Hood details.\n\n2. Try to [install R and R Studio](https://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/reference/#installing-r-and-r-studio) on your computer if you are able, before next class. You will still always have RStudio.cloud available all to use in your browser, but it is much better to have a real version of `R` and `R Studio` on your own machine to work with all semester.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\nToday is introductory, but please heed this timeless message:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message to students from the Doggfather himself, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SnoopDogg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wsSANYv8u6\">pic.twitter.com/wsSANYv8u6</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Briggs (@ryancbriggs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryancbriggs/status/1293543531496308736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nPlease note going forward, the lesson numbers and topics (e.g. 1.1) on this website are *my* design, and will not match up with the textbook!\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. \n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/1.1-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/1.1-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"1.1-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/1.1-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Preliminary Statistics Survey Due By Next Class\n\nPlease take the [preliminary survey](/assignment/00-preliminary-survey) on your statistics and software background by nexrt class. This will help us all have a productive semester together.\n",
