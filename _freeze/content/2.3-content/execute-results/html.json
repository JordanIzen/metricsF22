Then we turn to fitting a line to data via *linear regression*. We overview the basic regression model, the parameters and how they are derived, and see how to work with regressions in `R` with `lm` and the tidyverse package [`broom`](https://broom.tidyverse.org/).\n\nWe consider an extended example about class sizes and test scores, which comes from a (Stata) dataset from an old textbook that I used to use, [Stock and Watson, 2007](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Stock-Introduction-to-Econometrics-Update-3rd-Edition/9780133486872.html?tab=resources). Download and follow along with the data from today's example:^[Note this is a `.dta` Stata file. You will need to (install and) load the package `haven` to `read_dta()` Stata files into a dataframe.]\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-table\"></i> `caschool.dta`](http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/caschool.dta)\n\nI have also made a RStudio Cloud project documenting all of the things we have been doing with this data that may help you when you start working with regressions (next class):\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-cloud\"></i> Class Size Regression Analysis](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/270168/content/4559643)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 3.1, Math and Probability Background Appendix A in Bailey\n\nNow that we return to the statistics, we will do a minimal overview of basic statistics and distributions. Review all of Bailey's appendices.\n\nChapter 2 is optional, but will give you a good overview of using data.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Variance](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.html#variance)\n- [Covariance](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.html#covariance)\n- [Correlation](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.html#correlation)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/2.3-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/2.3-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"2.3-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/2.3-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n",
