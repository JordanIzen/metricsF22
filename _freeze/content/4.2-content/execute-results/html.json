It has an example workflow setup that I recommend you follow: create an R project for your project, and organize all of your data, code, images, & text in this set of folders inside of your project.^[I also recommend you at least save this folder on Dropbox to keep it safe!] You can look at `Example_paper.qmd` to see my text and code in R markdown to write the paper, and look at `Example_paper.qdf` to see the final product.\n\nThe second is a quick and dirty example of what I am looking for in your paper project in this class, using the ongoing example of the effect of class size on test scores. You can also look at `paper.qmd` to see my text and code in R markdown, and `paper.pdf` to see the final product. Note that this is an example I put quickly together with minimal effort as an example for you all, it does *not* necessarily mean it is an “A” quality paper!\n\nIf you are using R markdown to write your final paper, you should consult [class 1.5](/content/1.5-content) again, along with the [1.5 “R practice”](/r/1.5-r) that deals with the workflow repository.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-registered\"></i> R Practice\n\nToday you will be finishing [R practice problems](/r/4.1-r) on multivariate regression. Answers will be posted later on that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 4 Due Fri Nov 11\n[Problem Set 4](/assignments/04-problem-set) is due by the end of the day on Tuesday, November 11.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/4.1-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/4.1-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"4.1-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/4.1-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n",
