We will cover how to measure if a regression line is a good fit (using $R^2$ and $\\sigma_u$ or SER), and whether OLS estimators are *biased*. These will depend on four critical *assumptions about $u$.* \n\nIn doing so, we begin an ongoing exploration into inferential statistics, which will finally become clear in another week. The most confusing part is recognizing that there is a *sampling distribution of each OLS estimator*. We want to measure the center of that sampling distribution, to see if the estimator is *biased*. Next class we will measure the spread of that distribution. \n\nWe continue our extended example about class sizes and test scores, which comes from a (Stata) dataset from an old textbook that I used to use, [Stock and Watson, 2007](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Stock-Introduction-to-Econometrics-Update-3rd-Edition/9780133486872.html?tab=resources). Download and follow along with the data from today's example:[^1]\n\n[^1]: Note this is a `.dta` Stata file. You will need to (install and) load the package `haven` to `read_dta()` Stata files into a dataframe.\n\n-   [<i class=\"fas fa-table\"></i> `caschool.dta`](http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/caschool.dta)\n\nI have also made a RStudio Cloud project documenting all of the things we have been doing with this data that may help you when you start working with regressions (next class):\n\n-   [<i class=\"fas fa-cloud\"></i> Class Size Regression Analysis](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/270168/content/4559643)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n-   <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 3.2-3.4, 3.7-3.8 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Deriving the OLS Estimators](/resources/appendices/2.4-appendix.html#deriving-the-ols-estimators)\n- [Bias in $\\hat{\\beta_1}$](/resources/appendices/2.4-appendix.html#bias-in-hatbeta_1)\n- [Proof of the Unbiasedness of\n $\\hat{\\beta_1}$](/resources/appendices/2.4-appendix.html#proof-of-the-unbiasedness-of-hatbeta_1)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
