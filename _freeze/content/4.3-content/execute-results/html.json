We introduce them into regression models as **dummy variables** that can equal 0 or 1: where 1 indicates membership in a category, and 0 indicates non-membership.\n\nWe also look at what happens when categorical variables have more than two values: for regression, we introduce a dummy variable for each possible category - but be sure to leave out one reference category to avoid the dummy variable trap.\n\nWe then continue by examining how to use categorical data in regression, particularly focusing on *interactions* between variables. We look at three types of interaction effects:\n1. Interaction between a continuous variable & a dummy variable\n2. Interaction between two dummy variables\n3. Interaction between two continuous variables\n\nWe will also be working on [practice problems](/r/4.3-r) in `R`.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 6.1—6.2 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-registered\"></i> R Practice\n\nThis week you will be working on [R practice problems](/r/4.3-r) on categorical data. Answers will be posted later on that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 4 Due Fri Nov 11\n[Problem Set 4](/assignments/04-problem-set) is due by the end of the day on Friday, November 11.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/4.3-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/4.3-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"4.3-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/4.3-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n",
