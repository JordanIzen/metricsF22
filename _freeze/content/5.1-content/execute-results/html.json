Panel data contains its own unique challenges, because it contains a time series component for every individual, giving potential sources of bias. \n\nWe now need to understand the third assumption about $u_i$: no autocorrelation. The errors of our observations are likely going to be correlated within each individual and within each time period. \n\nWe can correct for these with a **fixed effects** model that isolates and absorbs some of that bias. In general, for a **two-way** fixed effects model: \n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Y}}_{it} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\text{X}_{1it} + \\beta_2 \\text{X}_{2it}+\\alpha_{i} + \\theta_{t} + \\nu_{it}$$\n\n\nEach observation is an individual $i$ at time $t$ (pay attention to the subscripts). \n\n- Let $Y_{it}$ be our dependent variable, and $X_{1it}$ be the independent variable of interest. We would like to estimate the causal effect of $X_{1it} \\rightarrow Y_{it}$.\n- $\\alpha_i$ is the **group fixed-effect**. It absorbs all unobservable factors that **vary by group** but **don’t change over time**.\n- $\\tau_t$ is the **time fixed-effect**. It absorbs all unobservable factors that **do not vary by group** but **change over time**.\n- Since the fixed effects *do not* pick up factors that **_both_ vary by group _and_ change over time**, we need to include other variables that might cause $X_{1it}$ to be endogenous: hence, $X_{2it}$\n- $\\nu_{it}$ is the remaining (random) error term (after we have pulled $\\alpha_i$ and $\\tau_t$ out of $u_{it}$. \n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 8.1—8.4 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 5 Due Mon Nov 28\n\n[Problem Set 5](/assignments/05-problem-set) is due by the end of the day on Wednesday, November 28.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
