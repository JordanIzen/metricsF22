If it has been a while (or never) since your last statistics class, this is one of the hardest concepts to understand at first glance. I recommend [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) [From sampling distributions through significance tests, for this. Though the whole class is helpful!] or Google for these concepts, as *every* statistics class will cover them in the standard way.\n\nThat being said, I *do not* cover inferential statistics in the standard way (see the [appendix](#Appendix) today below for an overview of the standard way). I think it will be more intuitive if I *show* you where these concepts come from by *simulating* a sampling distribution, as opposed to reciting the theoretical sampling distributions.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch.4 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Ch. 10 (optionally 8-9) in *Modern Dive* ](https://moderndive.netlify.com/10-inference-for-regression.html)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Visualizing Probability and Inference ](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/frequentist-inference/index.html)\n\nBailey teaches inferential statistics in the classical way (with reference to theoretical $Z$ and $t$ distributions, and $Z$ and $t$ tests). This is all valid. Again, you may wish to brush up with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) [From sampling distributions through significance tests, for this. Though the whole class is helpful!].\n\nThe latter \"book\" (also free online, like R4DS) uses the `infer` package to run simulations for inferential statistics. Chapter 10 is focused on regression (but I also recommend the chapters leading up to it, which are on inferential statistics broadly, using this method).\n\nThe final link is a great website for visualizing basic statistic concepts like probability, distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, central limit theorem, and regression.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-registered\"></i> R Practice\n\nToday we will finish working on [practice problems](/r/2.5-r). Answers will be posted on that page later.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Inference via Simulation vs. Classical Statistics](/resources/appendices/2.6-appendix.html#inference-via-simulation-vs-classical-statistics)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/2.6-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/2.6-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"2.6-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/2.6-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n",
