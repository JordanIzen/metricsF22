We know from DAGs that we often need to “adjust for” or “control for variables” in order to identify the causal effect we are interested in. Now we give a particular name and set of conditions for when we need to control a variable: .b[“omitted variable bias”], where some variable both causes $Y$ (is in $u)$, and is correlated with $X$. To avoid introducing the bias, we now *include* it as an additional independent variable in our regression. \n\nThus, we now begin exploring multivariate regression with multiple regressors:\n\n\n$$Y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_{1i}+ \\beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i$$\n\n\nNext class we will learn more about how the introduction of additional variables affects our model.\n\nWe continue the extended example about class sizes and test scores, which comes from a (Stata) dataset from an old textbook that I used to use, [Stock and Watson, 2007](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Stock-Introduction-to-Econometrics-Update-3rd-Edition/9780133486872.html?tab=resources). Download and follow along with the data from today's example:^[Note this is a `.dta` Stata file. You will need to (install and) load the package `haven` to `read_dta()` Stata files into a dataframe.]\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-table\"></i> `caschool.dta`](http://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/data/caschool.dta)\n\nI have also made a RStudio Cloud project documenting all of the things we have been doing with this data that may help you when you start working with regressions:\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-cloud\"></i> Class Size Regression Analysis (Cloud R project)](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/163934/project/2940189)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Class Size Regression Analysis (output)](/data/class_size_regression_analysis.html)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 5.1 in Bailey, *Real Econometrics*\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/3.3-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/3.3-slides.png\" width=600 alt = \"3.3-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/3.3-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n",
