GDP Growth Rate | Std. dev. | $n$ |\n|--------------|----------------------|-----------|-----|\n| Common Law | $1.84$ | $3.55$ | $19$ |\n| Civil Law | $4.97$ | $4.27$ | $141$ |\n| Difference | $-3.13$ | $1.02$ | $-$ |\n\n### Part A\n\nUsing the group means, write a regression equation for a regression of GDP Growth rate on Common Law. Define:\n\n\n$$\\text{Common Law}_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if country } i \\text{ has common law} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if country } i \\text{ has civil law}\\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part B\n\nHow do we use the regression to find the average GDP Growth rate for common law countries? For civil law countries? For the difference?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part C\n\nLooking at the coefficients, does there appear to be a statistically significant difference in average GDP Growth Rates between Civil and Common law countries?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part D\n\nIs the estimate on the difference likely to be unbiased? Why or why not?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n### Part E\n\nNow using the same table above, reconstruct the regression equation if instead of Common Law, we had used:\n\n\n$$\\text{Civil Law}_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if country } i \\text{ has civil law} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if country } i \\text{ has common law}\\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n## Question 6\n\nSuppose a real estate agent collects data on houses that have sold in a particular neighborhood over the past year, with the following variables:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| $Price_h$ | price of house $h$ (in thousands of $) |\n| $Bedrooms_h$ | number of bedrooms in house $h$ |\n| $Baths_h$ | number of bathrooms in house $h$ |\n| $Pool_h$ | $\\begin{cases} =1 & \\text{if house } h \\text{ has a pool} \\\\ =0 & \\text{if house } h \\text{ does not have a pool} \\end{cases}$ |\n| $View_h$ |  $\\begin{cases} =1 & \\text{if house } h \\text{ has a nice view} \\\\ =0 & \\text{if house } h \\text{ does not have a nice view} \\end{cases}$ |\n\n### Part A\n\nSuppose she estimates the following regression:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Price}}_h=119.20+29.76 \\, \\text{Bedrooms}_h+24.09 \\, \\text{View}_h+14.06 \\, (\\text{Bedrooms}_h \\times \\text{View}_h)$$\n\n\nWhat does each coefficient mean?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part B\n\nWrite out _two_ separate regression equations, one for houses _*_with_ a nice view, and one for homes _without_ a nice view.

We have data on the deviation in temperature from pre-industrial times (in Celcius), and the year.\n\n### Part A\n\nSuppose we estimate the following simple model relating deviation in temperature to year:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Temperature}}_i=-10.46+0.006 \\, \\text{Year}_i$$\n\nInterpret the coefficient on Year (i.e. $\\hat{\\beta_1})$\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part B\n\nPredict the (deviation in) temperature for the year 1900 and for the year 2000.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part C\n\nSuppose we believe temperature deviations are increasing at an increasing rate, and introduce a quadratic term and estimate the following regression model:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Temperature (dev)}}_i=155.68-0.116 \\, \\text{Year}_i+0.000044 \\, \\text{Year}_i^2$$\n\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part D\n\nOur quadratic function is a $U$-shape.

While we cannot measure the amount of cell phone activity while driving, we do have a good proxy variable, the number of cell phone subscriptions (in 1000s) in a state, along with traffic fatalities in that state.\n\n### Part A\n\nSuppose we estimate the following simple regression:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{fatalities}}_i=123.98+0.091\\, \\text{cell plans}_i$$\n\nInterpret the coefficient on cell plans (i.e. $\\hat{\\beta_1})$.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n### Part B\n\nNow suppose we estimate the regression using a linear-log model:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{fatalities}}_i=-3557.08+515.81\\, \\text{ln(cell plans}_i)$$\n\nInterpret the coefficient on ln(cell plans) (i.e. $\\hat{\\beta_1})$\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part C\n\nNow suppose we estimate the regression using a log-linear model:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{ln(fatalities})}_i=5.43+0.0001\\,\\text{cell plans}_i$$\n\nInterpret the coefficient on cell plans (i.e. $\\hat{\\beta_1})$\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part D\n\nNow suppose we estimate the regression using a log-log model:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{ln(fatalities})}_i=-0.89+0.85\\,\\text{ln(cell plans})_i$$\n\nInterpret the coefficient on cell plans (i.e. $\\hat{\\beta_1})$\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part E\n\nSuppose we include several other variables into our regression and want to determine which variable(s) have the largest effects, a State's cell plans, population, or amount of miles driven. Suppose we decide to _standardize_ the data to compare units, and we get:\n\n\n$$\\widehat{\\text{fatalities}}_Z=0+0.002 \\, \\text{cell plans}_{Z}-0.00007\\,\\text{population}_{Z}+0.019\\,\\text{miles driven}_{Z}$$\n\nInterpret the coefficients on cell plans, population, and miles driven. Which has the largest effect on fatalities?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part F\n\nSuppose we wanted to make the claim that it is _only_ miles driven, and neither population nor cell phones determine traffic fatalities. Write (i) the null hypothesis for this claim and (ii) the estimated restricted regression equation.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part G\n\nSuppose the $R^2$ on the original regression from Part E was 0.9221, and the $R^2$ from the restricted regression is 0.9062. With 50 observations, calculate the $F$-statistic.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n# R Questions\n\nAnswer the following questions using `R`. When necessary, please write answers in the same document (rendered to `html` or `pdf`, typed `.doc(x)`, or handwritten) as your answers to the above questions. Be sure to include (email or print an `.R` file, or show in your rendered quarto document) your code and the outputs of your code with the rest of your answers.\n\n## Question 9\n\n- [`LeadMortality.csv`](http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/LeadMortality.csv)\n\nDownload and read in `LeadMortality.csv` dataset. If you don't want to download/upload it, you can read it in directly from the url by running this chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run or edit this chunk\nlead <- read_csv(\"http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/LeadMortality.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLead is toxic, particularly for young children, and for this reason government regulations severely restrict the amount of lead in our environment. In the early part of the 20^th^ century, the underground water pipes in many U.S. cities contained lead, and lead from these pipes leached into drinking water. This exercise will have you investigate the effect of these lead pipes on infant mortality. This dataset contains data on:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `infrate` | infant mortality rate (deaths per 100 in population) |\n| `lead` | $=1$ if city has lead water pipes, $=0$ if did not have lead pipes |\n| `pH` | water pH |\n\nand several demographic variables for 172 U.S. cities in 1900.\n\n### Part A\n\nUsing `R` to examine the data, find the average infant mortality rate for cities *with* lead pipes and for cities *without* lead pipes. Then, calculate the difference in mortality rates, and run a $t$-test to determine if this difference is statistically significant.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part B\n\nRun a regression of `infrate` on `lead`, and write down the estimated regression equation. Use the regression coefficients to find:\n\n- the average infant mortality rate for cities with lead pipes\n- the average infant mortality rate for cities without lead pipes\n- the difference between the averages for cities with or without lead pipes\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part C\n\nDoes the pH of the water matter? Include `ph` in your regression from part B. Write down the estimated regression equation, and interpret each coefficient. What happens to the estimate on `lead`?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part D\n\nThe amount of lead leached from lead pipes normally depends on the chemistry of the water running through the pipes: the more acidic the water (lower pH), the more lead is leached. Create an interaction term between lead and pH, and run a regression of `infrate` on `lead`, `pH`, and your interaction term. Write down the estimated regression equation. Is this interaction effect significant?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part E\n\nWhat we actually have now are two different regression lines. Visualize this with a scatterplot between `infrate` $(Y)$ and `ph` $(X)$, making your points and regression lines colored by `lead`.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part F\n\nDo the two regression lines have the same intercept? The same slope? Use the original regression in part D to test these possibilities.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part G\n\nTake your regression equation from part D and rewrite it as two separate regression equations (one for no lead and one for lead). Interpret the coefficients for each.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part H\n\nDouble check your calculations in G are correct by running the regression in D twice, once for cities without lead pipes and once for cities with lead pipes. [Hint: `filter()` the data first, then use the filtered data for the `data=` in each regression.]\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part I\n\nUse `modelsummary` to make a nice output table of all of your regressions from parts B, C, and D.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n## Question 10\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-table\"></i> `freedom.csv`](http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/freedom.csv)\n\nLet's look at economic freedom and GDP per capita using some data I sourced from [Gapminder](https://gapminder.org/tools)^[GDP per capita (2018)], [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/content/freedom-world-data-and-resources)^[Political freedom score (2018)] and [Fraser Institute Data](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/economic-freedom/dataset?geozone=world&year=2016&page=dataset)^[Economic Freedom score (2016)] and cleaned up for you, with the following variables:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `Country` | Name of country |\n| `ISO` | Code of country (good for plotting) |\n| `econ_freedom` | Economic Freedom Index score (2016) from 1 (least) to 10 (most free) |\n| `pol_freedom` | Political freedom index score (2018) from 1 (least) top 10 (most free) |\n| `gdp_pc` | GDP per capita (2018 USD) |\n| `continent` | Continent of country |\n\nDownload and read in `LeadMortality.csv` dataset. If you don't want to download/upload it, you can read it in directly from the url by running this chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run or edit this chunk\nfreedom <- read_csv(\"http://metricsf22.classes.ryansafner.com/files/data/freedom.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Part A\n\nDoes economic freedom affect GDP per capita? Create a scatterplot of `gdp_pc` (`Y`) against `econ_freedom` (`x`). Does the effect appear to be linear or nonlinear?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n### Part B\n\nRun a simple regression of `gdp_pc` on `econ_freedom`. Write out the estimated regression equation. What is the marginal effect of `econ_freedom` on `gdp_pc`?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part C\n\nAdd the quadratic regression line to your scatterplot. This just requires a special formula inside an additional layer: `geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = \"y ~ x + I(x^2)\")`.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part D\n\nWhat is the marginal effect of `econ_freedom` on `gdp_pc`?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part E\n\nAs a quadratic model, this relationship should predict an` econ_freedom` score where `gdp_pc` is at a *minimum*. What is that minimum Economic Freedom score, and what is the associated GDP per capita?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n### Part F\n\nRun a cubic model to see if we should keep going up in polynomials. Write out the estimated regression equation. Should we add a cubic term?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part G\n\nAnother way we can _test_ for non-linearity is to run an $F$-test on all non-linear variables - i.e. the quadratic term and the cubic term $(\\hat{\\beta_2}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_3}$) and test against the null hypothesis that:\n\n\n$$H_0: \\hat{\\beta_2} = \\hat{\\beta_3} = 0$$\n\n\nRun this joint hypothesis test, and what can you conclude?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n\n### Part H\n\nInstead of a polynomial model, try out a logarithmic model. It is hard to interpret percent changes on an index, but it is easy to understand percent changes in GDP per capita, so run a _log-linear_ regression. Write out the estimated regression equation. What is the marginal effect of `econ_freedom`?\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part I\n\nMake a scatterplot of your log-linear model with a regression line.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n\n### Part J\n\nPut all of your results together in a regression output table with `modelsummary` from your answers in questions B, C, G, and H.\n\n<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->\n",
