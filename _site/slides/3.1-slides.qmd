## Two Types of Uses For Regression

$$\color{orange}{Y}=\color{teal}{\beta}(\color{purple}{X})$$
where $\color{orange}{Y}$ is numeric: 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

1. [Causal inference]{.hi}: estimate $\color{teal}{\hat{\beta}}$ to determine how changes in $\color{purple}{X}$ **cause** changes in $\color{orange}{Y}$
  - Care more about accurately estimating and understanding $\color{teal}{\hat{\beta}}$
  - Remove as much **bias** in $\color{teal}{\hat{\beta}}$ as possible
  - Don’t care much about **goodness of fit**! (You’ll never get it in the complex real world)

:::

::: {.column width="50"}
2. [Prediction]{.hi-purple}: predict $\color{orange}{\hat{Y}}$ using an estimated $\color{teal}{\hat{\beta}}$
  - Care more about getting $\color{orange}{\hat{Y}}$ as accurate as possible, $\color{teal}{\hat{\beta}}$ is an unknown “black-box”
  - Tweak models to maximize $R^2$, minimize $\hat{\sigma}_u$ (at all costs)

:::
:::

## Recall: Two Big Problems with Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- We use econometrics to [identify]{.hi} causal relationships & make [inferences]{.hi-purple} about them:

1. Problem for [identification]{.hi}: [endogeneity]{.hi}
    - $X$ is **exogenous** if its variation is **unrelated** to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$
    - $X$ is **endogenous** if its variation is **related** to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$
    
2. Problem for [inference]{.hi-purple}: [randomness]{.hi-purple}
    - Data is random due to **natural sampling variation**
    - Taking one sample of a population will yield slightly different information than another sample of the same population

## The Two Problems: Identification and Inference

[[Sample]{.b} $\color{#6A5ACD}{\xrightarrow{\text{statistical inference}}}$ [Population]{.b} $\color{#e64173}{\xrightarrow{\text{causal indentification}}}$ [Unobserved Parameters]{.b}]{.center}

- We saw how to statistically [infer]{.hi-purple} values of population parameters using our sample
  - [Purely empirical, math & statistics]{.hi-turquoise} 

. . .

- We now confront the problem of [identifying]{.hi} causal relationships within population
  - [Endogeneity problem]{.hi}
  - Even if we had perfect data on the whole population, [“Does X truly cause Y?”]{.hi}, and can we measure that effect?
  - [More philosophy, theory, and creativity than math & statistics!]{.hi-turquoise} 

- Truly you should do this first, *before* you get data to make inferences!

## What Does Causation Mean?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We are going to reflect on one of the biggest problems in [epistemology]{.hi}, the philosophy of knowledge

- We see that X and Y are [associated]{.hi-turquoise} (or quantitatively, [correlated]{.hi-turquoise}), but how do we know if [X *causes* Y?]{.hi-slate}

## Random Control Trials (RCTs) I

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- The *ideal* way to demonstrate causation is through a [randomized control trial (RCT)]{.hi-turquoise} or ["random experiment"]{.hi-turquoise}
  - *Randomly* assign experimental units (e.g. people, firms, etc.) into groups
  - [Treatment group(s)]{.hi} get a treatment
  - [Control group]{.hi-purple} gets no treatment 
  - Compare average results of treatment vs control groups after treatment to observe the [average treatment effect (ATE)]{.hi-slate}
  
- [We will understand “causality” (for now) to mean the ATE from an ideal RCT]{.hi-slate}

# The Potential Outcomes Model {.centered background-color="#314f4f"}

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Suppose we have some outcome variable $Y$

. . .

- Individuals $(i)$ face a choice between two outcomes (such as being [treated]{.hi} or [not treated]{.hi-purple}):
  - $\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$: outcome when individual $i$ is [not treated]{.hi-purple}
  - $\color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}}$: outcome when individual $i$ is [treated]{.hi}

✨ $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$  ✨

- $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i}$ is the [causal effect]{.hi-slate} of treatment on individual $i$

# 

![](images/twopaths.jpg)

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

✨ $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$  ✨

. . .

- This is a nice way to think about the ideal proof of causality, but this is impossible to observe!

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{red}{?} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$$

- This is a nice way to think about the ideal proof of causality, but this is impossible to observe!

- [Individual counterfactuals do not exist (“the path not taken”)]{.hi-purple}

- You will always only ever get one of these per individual!

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{red}{?}$$

- This is a nice way to think about the ideal proof of causality, but this is impossible to observe!

- [Individual counterfactuals do not exist (“the path not taken”)]{.hi-purple}

- You will always only ever get one of these per individual!
  - e.g. what would your life have been like if you did not go to Trinity?? 

- So what can we do?

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{\mathbb{E}[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\mathbb{E}[Y_i^{0}]}$$

- Have large groups, and take *averages* instead!

- [Average Treatment Effect (ATE)]{.hi-slate}: difference in the average (expected value) of outcome $Y$ between [treated individuals]{.pink} and [untreated individuals]{.purple}
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta} = \color{#e64173}{(\bar{Y}|T=1)}-\color{#6A5ACD}{(\bar{Y}|T=0)}$$

- $T_i$ is a [binary variable]{.hi-turquoise}, $= \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} & \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} & \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}$

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

$$\color{#314f4f}{ATE} = \color{#e64173}{\mathbb{E}[Y_i^{1}]} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\mathbb{E}[Y_i^{0}]}$$

Again: 

- **Either** we observe individual $i$ in the [treatment group]{.hi} $\color{#e64173}{(T=1)}$, i.e.
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{red}{?}$$

- **Or** we observe individual $i$ in the [control group]{.hi-purple} $\color{#6A5ACD}{(T=0)}$, i.e.
$$\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{red}{?} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}} $$

- **Never both** at the same time for individual $i$:

✨ $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i} = \color{#e64173}{Y_i^{1}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}$  ✨

## Example: The Effect of Having Health Insurance I

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon=false}

## Example 
What is the effect of having health insurance on health outcomes?

- National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) asks “Would you say your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?”

- **Outcome variable $(Y)$**: Index of health (1-poor to 5-excellent) in a sample of married NHIS respondents in 2009 who may or may not have health insurance

- **Treatment $(X)$**: Having health insurance  (vs. not)

## Example: The Effect of Having Health Insurance II

![](images/econometricshealthnocaption.png){fig-align="center"}

[Angrist, Joshua & Jorn-Steffen Pischke, 2015, *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*]{.source}

## Example: The Effect of Having Health Insurance III

- $Y$: outcome variable (health index score, 1-5)

- $Y_i$: health score of an individual $i$

- Individual $i$ has a choice, leading to one of two outcomes:
  - $\color{#6A5ACD}{Y^0_i}$: individual $i$ has *not* purchased health insurance [(“Control”)]{.hi-purple}
  - $\color{#e64173}{Y^1_i}$: individual $i$ has purchased health insurance [(“Treatment”)]{.hi}
    
- $\color{#314f4f}{\delta_i}=\color{#e64173}{Y^1_i}-\color{#6A5ACD}{Y^0_i}$: causal effect for individual $i$ of purchasing health insurance

## Example: Thinking About the Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Basic comparisons tell us *something* about outcomes, but not [ATE]{.hi-slate}

$$diff. = \color{#314f4f}{ATE} + \color{#FFA500}{\text{Selection Bias}}$$

- [Selection bias]{.hi-orange}: difference in average $Y^0_i$ between groups pre-treatment

- $Y^0_i$ includes *everything* about person $i$ relevant to health *except* treatment (insurance) status
  - Age, sex, height, weight, climate, smoker, exercise, diet, etc. 
  - Imagine a world where *nobody* gets insurance (treatment), who would have highest health scores?

## Understanding Selection Bias

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- [Treatment group]{.hi} and [control group]{.hi-purple} differ on average, for reasons *other* than getting treatment or not!

- [Control group]{.hi-purple} is not a good counterfactual for [treatment group]{.hi} without treatment
  - Average *untreated* outcome for the treatment group differs from average untreated outcome for *untreated* group

$$\color{#e64173}{Avg(}\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}\color{#e64173}{|T=1)}-\color{#6A5ACD}{Avg(Y_i^{0}|T=0)}$$
  - Recall we cannot observe $\color{#e64173}{Avg(}\color{#6A5ACD}{Y_i^{0}}\color{#e64173}{|T=1)}$!

## Understanding Selection Bias: Regression

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Consider the problem in regression form:

$$Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 T_i + u_i$$

- Where $T_i = \begin{cases} \color{#6A5ACD}{0} & \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{ if person is not treated}}\\\color{#e64173}{1} & \color{#e64173}{\text{ if person is treated}}\\ \end{cases}$

- The problem is $cor(T,u) \neq 0$!
  - $T_i$ (Treatment) is endogenous!
  - *Getting* treatment is correlated with other factors that determine health!

## Random Assignment: The Silver Bullet

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- If treatment is [randomly assigned]{.hi} for a large sample, it eliminates selection bias!

- Treatment and control groups differ **on average** by nothing *except* treatment status

- Creates [ceterus paribus]{.hi} conditions in economics: groups are identical **on average** (holding constant age, sex, height, etc.)

# Natural Experiments {.centered background-color="#314f4f"}

## The Quest for Causal Effects I

::: columns

- RCTs are considered the "gold standard" for causal claims

- But society is not our laboratory (probably a good thing!)

- We can rarely conduct experiments to get data

:::

## The Quest for Causal Effects II

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Instead, we often rely on [observational data]{.hi-purple}

- This data is *not random*!

- Must take extra care in forming an [identification strategy]{.hi}

- To make good claims about causation in society, we must get clever!

## Natural Experiments

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Economists often resort to searching for [natural experiments]{.hi}

- “Natural” events beyond our control occur that separate *otherwise similar* entities into a "treatment" group and a "control" group that we can compare 

- e.g. natural disasters, U.S. State laws, military draft

## Famous Natural Experiments in Empirical Economics

- [**Oregon Health Insurance Experiment**]{.green}: Oregon used lottery to grant Medicare access to 10,000 people, showing access to Medicaid increased use of health services, lowered debt, etc. relative to those not on Medicaid
- [**Angrist (1990)**]{.green} finds that lifetime earnings of (random) drafted Vietnam veterans is 15% lower than non-veterans
- [**Card & Kreuger (1994)**]{.green} find that minimum wage hike in fast-food restaurants on NJ side of border had no disemployment effects relative to restaurants on PA side of border during the same period
- [**Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001)**]{.green} find that inclusive institutions lead to higher economic development than extractive institutions, determined by a colony's disease environment in 1500
- We will look at some of these in greater detail throughout the course

> “The RCT is a useful tool, but I think that is a mistake to put method ahead of substance. I have written papers using RCTs...[but] no RCT can ever legitimately claim to have established causality. My theme is that RCTs have no special status, they have no exemption from the problems of inference that econometricians have always wrestled with, and there is nothing that they, and only they, can accomplish.”

> “People keep saying that the recent Nobelists ‘studied global poverty.’ This is exactly wrong. They made a commitment to a method, not a subject, and their commitment to method prevented them from studying global poverty.”

> “At a conference at Brookings in 2008 Paul Romer [2018 Nobelist] said: "You guys are like going to a doctor who says you have an allergy and you have cancer. With the skin rash we can divide you skin into areas and test variety of substances and identify with precision and some certainty the cause. Cancer we have some ideas how to treat it but there are a variety of approaches and since we cannot be sure and precise about which is best for you, we will ignore the cancer and not treat it.”
