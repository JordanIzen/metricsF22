Your responses will help me craft the course to see which material we need to focus on at greater length, especially review material.\n\n\n Download PDF  Answer Key\n\n\nQuestion 1\nUsing the following sample data:\n\\[8, 12, 9, 10, 11, 5, 15\\]\n\nFind the median.\nCalculate the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\)\nCalculate the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\)\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nFor a fair, six-sided die:\n\nWhat is the probability of rolling a 5?\nWhat is the probability of rolling an even number?\nWhat is the probability of rolling an even number or a 3?\nIf you have two fair dice, what is the probability of rolling a 6 on both dice?\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nHedge fund A earns an average rate of return of 2.5% per year with a standard deviation of 0.5%, while hedge fund B earns an average rate of return of 3.0% per year with a standard deviation of 2.0%. Which is more unusual, Hedge fund A earning a 4.0% return or hedge fund B earning a return -1.0% return? Why?1\n\n\nQuestion 4\nA discrete random variable \\(X\\) has the following pdf:\n\n\n\n \n  \n    x \n    p(x) \n  \n \n\n  \n    10 \n    0.1 \n  \n  \n    20 \n    0.2 \n  \n  \n    30 \n    0.3 \n  \n  \n    40 \n    0.4 \n  \n\n\n\n\nCalculate the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\) of \\(X\\).\n\n\nQuestion 5\nThe random variable \\(Y\\) is normally distributed with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 12\n\\[Y \\sim N (50,12)\\]\n\nWhat is the \\(Z\\)-score for \\(Y=74\\)?\nIn your own words, what does this \\(Z\\)-score mean?\nWhat is the probability that \\(Y\\) takes on a value greater than 74?\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nOn a scale of 1 (least) to 10 (most), how anxious are you about this class? Feel free to share any specific anxieties (they have a better chance to be specifically addressed if you do!).\n\n\nQuestion 7\nOn a scale of 1 (least) to 10 (most), how familiar would you say you are with computer programming and/or statistical software?\n\n\nQuestion 8\nList any statistical software packages (e.g. R, Microsoft Excel, Stata, SAS, SPSS, Minitab, etc.) and any programming languages (e.g. html, php, C/++, Python, LaTeX, etc.) you have had any experience with, and rate your proficiency between 1 (least) and 5 (most), if applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nHint: Standardize the two hedge funds.↩︎"

Starting next class, we will do a deep dive in to R for about 2 weeks. In preparation, please do the following before next class:\n\nGo to RStudio.cloud and register a (free) account with your Hood details.\nTry to install R and R Studio on your computer if you are able, before next class. You will still always have RStudio.cloud available all to use in your browser, but it is much better to have a real version of R and R Studio on your own machine to work with all semester."

Let’s start just by making a basic graph and saving it as an object called p. I have decided to map (aes()) each geom_point’s color to continent and size to pop:\n\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\np<-ggplot(gapminder) +\n  aes(x = gdpPercap,\n      y = lifeExp) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = pop,\n                 color = continent))\np\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Scales\nI don’t like the default choices ggplot2 has made for my point sizes for population, or the way it depicts them (in scientific notation) on the legend.\nI will set my own scale by setting the breaks1 manually, according to a vector I define as: c(100000, 1000000, 100000000, 1000000000). So, I will use one point size for populations of 100 thousand, a bigger one for a million, a bigger one for 100 millions, and the biggest for 1 billion.\nI am going to label these (on my legend) as the following vector: c(\"<1 million\",\"1 million\",\"100 million\", \"1 billion\").\nLastly, I don’t think the size of the billion circle is big enough, a billion is a lot of people! So I will set the range of sizes from size 1 point to size 10 point.\nTo do this, I include all of this inside the scale_size command (because I am scaling the size of points):\n\n# let's save this as p2\np2<-p+scale_size(breaks = c(100000, 1000000, 100000000, 1000000000), # cut offs\n             labels=c(\"<1 million\",\"1 million\",\"100 million\", \"1 billion\"), # labels on legend\n             range=c(1,10)) # min & max point size\n\n# let's see what we did\np2\n\n\n\n\nThis is also very hard to see the relationship (because it is nonlinear!). So I will rescale the x_axis logarithmically with base 10:\n\np2+scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\nDoing this already gives me a much clearer view of the relationship! But I don’t like the labels, or the breaks it has chosen, so I can customize them again:\n\np2+scale_x_log10(\n    breaks = c(10^3, 10^4, 10^5), # 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000\n    labels = scales::dollar)\n\n\n\n\nThe scales package has a nice command to format labels, in this case I am calling the scales::dollar function to print dollar signs in front of my axes numbers. I could have done it manually instead by setting labels = c(\"$1,000\", \"$10,000\", \"$100,000\")."

To do this, we are going to make use of another tidyverse package called forcats (dealing with factors), specifically the function fct_reorder(), which reorders a factor variable (our country) by the values of some other variable (our gdpPercap). We need to do this to our x variable aesthetic:\n\nbar2<-gap2007 %>%\n  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%\n  slice(1:20) %>%\n  ggplot(data = .)+\n  aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap), #<<\n      y = gdpPercap,\n      fill = continent)+\n  geom_col()+\n  coord_flip()\nbar2\n\n\n\n\nThis is already looking good. Here’s another creative way to depict the same thing in a more visually-striking way. Instead of using geom_bar(), let’s combine geom_flag (to serve as end points) and geom_segment()5 (line segments) to make the following version:"

It uses real data to test economic hypotheses, quantitatively estimate causal relationships between economic variables, and to make forecasts of future events. The primary tool that economists use for empirical analysis is ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, so the majority of this course will focus on understanding, applying, and extending OLS regressions.\nI assume you have some working knowledge of economics at the intermediate level and some basic statistical tools.The formal prerequisites for this course are ECON 205 and ECON 206; ECMG 212 or MATH 112; and ECON 305 or ECON 306. We will do some basic review of some necessary statistics and probability at the beginning until everyone is comfortable, before jumping right into regressions."

    "text": "Attendence\nYour day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy."

    "text": "Late Assignments\nI will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 15 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nPapers: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your assignment is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."

Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades.

    "text": "Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours\nStudents must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:"

    "text": "Netiquette\nWhen using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X’?” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”)."

If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors."
