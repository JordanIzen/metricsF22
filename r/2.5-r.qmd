## Getting Set Up

First, create a new R project on your computer by choosing `File -> New Project...`, create a new directory (a folder somewhere on your computer), and then choose `New Project` and then give it a name like `2.5-R-Practice` [This is a good time to practice not using spaces in file and folder names!].

Then, download and open the Quarto file above and move it to the file folder on your computer that you just created for the R Project, and open it in R Studio. If there are any packages that you are missing, a yellow banner on top may inform you `Package X is required but is not installed`, click `Install` to install them, or equivalently use the console to `install.packages()`.

**Alternatively**, you can do everything on RStudio.Cloud, which has its own R Project that includes the Quarto file.
